# Augmented Analytics in OAC

This POC illustrates how Augmented Analytics is performed in OAC. 
Augmented analytics extracts Insights from Large Data Sources. It uses both ML and AI techniques, where Machine Learning handles the data preparation process like processing the ingested data, preparing the relevant data and looking for patterns, and AI handles the initial analysis using models and algorithms. 

**The following steps shows how to perform Augmented Analytics in OAC.**

**1. Sign in to the Oracle Analytics Cloud, and Create a Project.**

**2.	Add a Data Set to the Project by Dropping a Data File such as an Excel Spreadsheet.**

**3.	Select any of the elements of Data Set for example Category, right click on the element and click Explain Category**

**4.	View the Basic Facts about the element (Category), scroll down and view the charts which summarizes the values of element by the measures in the data set. Click checkmarks on Charts to add into the Canvas as shown below.**
