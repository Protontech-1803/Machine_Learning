# ANN Learning Model using TensorFlow

The POC, illustrates training the datasets from MNIST containing handwritten digits and plotting the accuracy per iteration. The following are the steps to train the data sets and to find the accuracy of the leaning model.

**Steps for Artificial Neural Network Model to train the dataset and to find the accuracy of the model using TensorFlow:**

1.	Install TensorFlow in Google Colaboratory(colab) Notebook.

2.	Load the MNIST datasets using keras.datasets.mnist as shown below.
 
3.	Build and compile the model using functional API’s as shown below.
 
4.	Once the model is created and complied, train the model using model.fit as shown below.
 
5.	Plot the graph using matplotlib library as shown below
Note: Blue line - Training set data
	Red line – Testing set data for the machine

 
6.	Evaluate the models accuracy using model.evaluate API.
 
7.	The model is 98% accurate as shown above snapshot.
